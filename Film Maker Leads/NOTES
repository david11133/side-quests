I am required to do the job of the lead generation. I am working for company called "Big Story". Big Story is a film equipment rental company in Dubai that rents high-end gear (RED Komodo cameras, lighting, audio, etc.). They need a system to: Find potential customers (filmmakers, production houses, etc.), Filter and score these leads, Deliver qualified leads to their sales team.
I have created a scoring system to score the gathered data and find best of them. here it is:

Now I want to do a deep search for those. I think we can use sources like LinkedIn, Instagram, Google Maps, Industry Directories, or whatever you can find those data.
I believe we can get data like: | Name | Company | Role | Location | Platform | Profile URL | Phone | Email | Instagram | Recent Work | Gear Mentioned | Activity Score | Role Score | Location Score | Gear Score | Budget Score | TOTAL SCORE |
You have to search with all possible keywords in English and Arabic. do whatever required to get data like that. 
Can you search and get like 10-20 rows? If you could, please do it and give me the data in a csv file or whatever.
