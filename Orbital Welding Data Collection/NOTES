Check mark features

I have a sheet that has a list of products and each one has features. the feature column for each item is a bullet point for example:
""- Next-generation orbital welding power source
 - Fixed configuration variant for stable applications
 - Compatible with all AMI fusion weld heads
 - 100% duty cycle capability
 - Advanced control and interface technology""

I want to move that to another sheet in another column called check mark features. but it need a little refinement to make it in a one sentence. here are some examples:
"Fixed configuration orbital welding power source with full-duty cycle and advanced control tech."
"Stainless steel concentric clamping system for DC115-BM, securing 0.5–4.5" OD tubes with fine depth control."
"SAXX-210 orbital welding power supply with integrated and detachable water cooling, 200A DC TIG output with oscillation option, advanced cooling monitoring, and compatibility with major weld head brands."

I will send to you a list of features for each product. you have to create a table with two columns, prod name (you can name them just prod1, prod2, etc.) and the other column is the check mark features. 

Also if you find products as "Not Found", please define them as "Not Found" too. and there are some duplicated items, I want you to keep them duplicated and write them too in the table.

Lets start with those 10 products:


------------------------------------------
Great now I have more products but those ones don't have any data available. I just have the names. so, you will have to search the internet and generate a similar table for them. you might find duplicated products,  want you to keep them as they are duplicated also if you can't find a specific product on the internet, try to get it from similar products on the internet or even guess it. NOTE that I don't want you to write things in the data like "Generated", "Guessed", etc. just write the data, no more, or less

Check mark features (Not Found Ones)

I have a list of products that I want you to make a search and get check mark features. here are some examples of how it should be:

"Fixed configuration orbital welding power source with full-duty cycle and advanced control tech."
"Stainless steel concentric clamping system for DC115-BM, securing 0.5–4.5" OD tubes with fine depth control."
"SAXX-210 orbital welding power supply with integrated and detachable water cooling, 200A DC TIG output with oscillation option, advanced cooling monitoring, and compatibility with major weld head brands."

You have to generate a table of 2 columns, prod name, check mark features. Note that you may find duplicated items, I want you to keep them as they are duplicated in the table and don't remove them. 

Lets start with those 10 items:


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feature names text

I have a sheet that contains an attribute called "Feature". each product has some bullet points of features. for example:
- Top assembly component for Arc machines M107 orbital welding power supply 
- Contains control interface, cooling systems, and electrical components 
- Engineered for reliable performance in continuous duty applications 
- Facilitates easy access for maintenance and component replacement 
- Essential spare part for M107 system repair and refurbishment

Now I will move that to another sheet that has those sections:
Feature Name 1	Feature Text	Feature Name 2	Feature Text	Feature Name 3	Feature Text	Feature Name 4	Feature Text

I need to convert those feature bullet points to those format in the new sheet. I know there are more than 4 bullet points sometimes but you can handle this through refining it or if some products have less than four, you can just leave the empty sections and write "Not Found". 

I will send to you 10 product features each time. You have to create a table with 9 columns, Product name  Feature Name 1	Feature Text	Feature Name 2	Feature Text	Feature Name 3	Feature Text	Feature Name 4	Feature Text

and the 10 rows.

Here are some examples of how data should be like:

Lets start with those 10 items:



-------------------------------------------------

Now I have more products but with now feature data. so, I will give you product names and you required to search the internet for them and generate a similar table for them.
and if you can't find some specific products, please try to get it from similar products or even guess them. and also note that I don't want you to write things in the data like "Guessed", "generated", etc. just write the data.
lets start with those 5 items:

-------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Header, text, left col, right col


I want to send to you some items names and you required to generate table with those columns:
Prod Name  Header	Text:	Left Column	Right Column

You have to search the internet for right data and if you  can't find a specific item, please try to guess it from previous or similar items on the internet.

here is an example:

Detail Text

I have an old sheet that contains columns called: "Header+ Intro", "Body Content", "Specification". You required combine the following product details into a concise, customer-friendly product description suitable for a website Detail Page. Keep it factual, clear, and professional. Remove redundancies and turn bulleted specifications into readable sentences. 

Header + Intro: ...
Body Content: ...
Specifications: ...

I will send to you around 50 products, may more or less at the one time and you have to write them in a table with two columns, product name and the new column that combines all those you can name it "Detail Text"


You have to a table with two columns, prod name and the detail text that contains the combined data from the three columns. Also if there are any repeated rows you have to repeat them too with the same content, and if there is something defined as not found you have to put it as "Not Found" too.

I will send to you 5 products at a time. 
Lets start with those 5:


--------------------------------------------

Now I have more products but without data available in the sheet, so I will send to you just the product names and you have to search the internet and generate a similar table. If you can't find a specific product please try to fill it with data related to it even if it's from items very similar to it or even guessing it, but NOTE that I don't want you to write things in the data like "Guessed", "Generated", etc. and also don't write anything in the data that is not useful like "standard description", etc. just write the data cause I will import it in a website so I want it to be ready.
lets start with those 5 products:

FAQ

I have a list of product names in a sheet and each product has a list of question and answers. for example product ""C" BORE TOOL BIT (2.1"-7.2" ID)" has a cell beside it that has it like that:

""- Q1: What is the maximum pipe ID that this tool can accommodate?
A1: The C Bore Tool Bit is designed for pipes with inner diameters ranging from 2.1 inches to 7.2 inches, with a 4:1 lead out ratio.

- Q2: What is the cutting depth of this counterbore tool?
A2: The tool provides a 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) counterbore depth, suitable for most orbital welding applications.

- Q3: Which Tri Tool machines are compatible with this tool bit?
A3: This tool is compatible with Tri Tool BEVELMASTER Model 208B and 212B machines that accept form tool modules.

- Q4: What materials can this tool cut?
A4: The C Bore Tool Bit is specifically rated for carbon steel pipe and similar materials used in orbital welding applications.

- Q5: How durable is the Durabit material?
A5: Durabit material provides extended tool life compared to standard high-speed steel, reducing replacement frequency and improving cost-effectiveness.""


all this written in a one cell. sometimes, it's separated with - and sometimes not. whatever, I want you to rewrite it in a table with three columns, prod name, FAQ name, text

the FAQ name should contain a list of questions all in one cell like:

""- Q1: What is the maximum pipe ID that this tool can accommodate?

- Q2: What is the cutting depth of this counterbore tool?

- Q3: Which Tri Tool machines are compatible with this tool bit?

- Q4: What materials can this tool cut?

- Q5: How durable is the Durabit material?""

and the text should have the answers in list in one cell like:

""- A1: The C Bore Tool Bit is designed for pipes with inner diameters ranging from 2.1 inches to 7.2 inches, with a 4:1 lead out ratio.

- A2: The tool provides a 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) counterbore depth, suitable for most orbital welding applications.

- A3: This tool is compatible with Tri Tool BEVELMASTER Model 208B and 212B machines that accept form tool modules.

- A4: The C Bore Tool Bit is specifically rated for carbon steel pipe and similar materials used in orbital welding applications.

- A5: Durabit material provides extended tool life compared to standard high-speed steel, reducing replacement frequency and improving cost-effectiveness.""

I will send to you a list of five item questions and answers at a time and you can write the prod name as prod1, prod2, etc. 

You will find some repeated items. I want you to keep it repeated too and also if you find something defined as "Not Found", put it as "Not Found" too.

So lets start with those 5 items. you should give me a table of 3 columns and 5 rows.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Feature names and text

I have a sheet that contains list of products and some features of it in a specific style and template. it has those columns:
Check Mark Features	Feature Name 1	Feature Text	Feature Name 2	Feature Text	Feature Name 3	Feature Text	Feature Name 4	Feature Text
and the data are like that:
