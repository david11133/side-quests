Check mark features

I have a sheet that has a list of products and each one has features. the feature column for each item is a bullet point for example:
""- Next-generation orbital welding power source
 - Fixed configuration variant for stable applications
 - Compatible with all AMI fusion weld heads
 - 100% duty cycle capability
 - Advanced control and interface technology""

I want to move that to another sheet in another column called check mark features. but it need a little refinement to make it in a one sentence. here are some examples:
"Fixed configuration orbital welding power source with full-duty cycle and advanced control tech."
"Stainless steel concentric clamping system for DC115-BM, securing 0.5–4.5" OD tubes with fine depth control."
"SAXX-210 orbital welding power supply with integrated and detachable water cooling, 200A DC TIG output with oscillation option, advanced cooling monitoring, and compatibility with major weld head brands."

I will send to you a list of features for each product. you have to create a table with two columns, prod name (you can name them just prod1, prod2, etc.) and the other column is the check mark features. 

Also if you find products as "Not Found", please define them as "Not Found" too. and there are some duplicated items, I want you to keep them duplicated and write them too in the table.

Lets start with those 10 products:


------------------------------------------
Great now I have more products but those ones don't have any data available. I just have the names. so, you will have to search the internet and generate a similar table for them. you might find duplicated products,  want you to keep them as they are duplicated also if you can't find a specific product on the internet, try to get it from similar products on the internet or even guess it. NOTE that I don't want you to write things in the data like "Generated", "Guessed", etc. just write the data, no more, or less

Check mark features (Not Found Ones)

I have a list of products that I want you to make a search and get check mark features. here are some examples of how it should be:

"Fixed configuration orbital welding power source with full-duty cycle and advanced control tech."
"Stainless steel concentric clamping system for DC115-BM, securing 0.5–4.5" OD tubes with fine depth control."
"SAXX-210 orbital welding power supply with integrated and detachable water cooling, 200A DC TIG output with oscillation option, advanced cooling monitoring, and compatibility with major weld head brands."

You have to generate a table of 2 columns, prod name, check mark features. Note that you may find duplicated items, I want you to keep them as they are duplicated in the table and don't remove them. 

Lets start with those 10 items:


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feature names text

I have a sheet that contains an attribute called "Feature". each product has some bullet points of features. for example:
- Top assembly component for Arc machines M107 orbital welding power supply 
- Contains control interface, cooling systems, and electrical components 
- Engineered for reliable performance in continuous duty applications 
- Facilitates easy access for maintenance and component replacement 
- Essential spare part for M107 system repair and refurbishment

Now I will move that to another sheet that has those sections:
Feature Name 1	Feature Text	Feature Name 2	Feature Text	Feature Name 3	Feature Text	Feature Name 4	Feature Text

I need to convert those feature bullet points to those format in the new sheet. I know there are more than 4 bullet points sometimes but you can handle this through refining it or if some products have less than four, you can just leave the empty sections and write "Not Found". 

I will send to you 10 product features each time. You have to create a table with 9 columns, Product name  Feature Name 1	Feature Text	Feature Name 2	Feature Text	Feature Name 3	Feature Text	Feature Name 4	Feature Text

and the 10 rows.

Here are some examples of how data should be like:
