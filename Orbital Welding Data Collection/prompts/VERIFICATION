    "Questions/Answers": """- Q1: What power supplies is the M2Y7-CW compatible with?
A1: The M2Y7-CW is designed specifically to interface with the M217 and M217P power supplies. It plugs directly into the M217 for power and is stackable to save bench space.

- Q2: What type of coolant should be used with the M2Y7-CW?
A2: AMI recommends using de-ionized water with an ethylene glycol mixture for optimal performance and to prevent corrosion and mineral buildup.

- Q3: How does the coolant fault detection work?
A3: The cooling unit has a built-in flow sensor that monitors coolant flow rate. If flow drops below a preset minimum (0.25 gpm), a fault signal is sent to the power supply, which will stop the weld sequence to prevent potential damage to the weld head.

- Q4: Can the M2Y7-CW operate independently without a power supply?
A4: Yes, the unit has independent/stand-alone operation capability, though it is designed to work optimally when integrated with the M217 or M217P power supplies.

- Q5: What is the maximum distance the weld head can be from the cooling unit?
A5: The M2Y7-CW can support weld head operation up to 100 feet away when using AMI's 1/4" tubing, and can pump coolant up to 30 feet vertically.""",

# Write Product Data to CSV with a different structure
with open('arc_machines_217_water_circulator_product_data.csv', 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=product_data.keys())
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerow(product_data)

print("Product Data CSV created successfully!")
```


And after that I want you to create another CSV with the source URLs you've got the info from.
this one csv will have those columns:
1. Product ID	
2. Description & Features	
3. Specs	
4. Technical Documentation	
5. Rental	
6. Pre-Owned	
7. Brochure	
8. Warranty Information	
9. Manufacturer Site

may you find another things that looks important, if so, please add it as a column too in the source URLs

you might add one or more than one link in each cell. for example the data will be like:
