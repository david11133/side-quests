Now, I want you to search all this info and get it in a table with with those 14 columns, so that I can copy them in my spreadsheet.
If you can't find info about a specific product please try to make up your own info and write it. you can get that from the name of the product or any related other product, but for sure don't do that in the "warranty information" column because this must be true, but otherwise you can make up or create info if you didn't find it online. you can do that from the product name and other related products. just get the info don't leave it empty otherwise the warranty info that you can put it as not found if you didn't find it.

Make sure the data is complete all columns and rows because sometimes you sent me the data and some columns I asked for are not exist
Also  make sure you do what I asked for you exactly and follow same data style as the example I provided for you.
